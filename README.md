## Description

This application, with the main user being a developer, quickly creates a professional README for any new project. The command-line application accepts user input and formats that input into a high-quality, professional README.md. It’s generated with the title of project, an interactive Table of Contents that will take you to the section you clicked on, and sections entitled Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, License, Contributing, Tests, and Questions. When the user chooses the license for their project, that page is added to the top of the README and a notice is added to the section of the README entitled license that explains which license the application is covered under. Finally, the user will input their GitHub profile and email, which is then added to the Questions section with a link to their profile and email address.

Clone the GitHub repository (https://github.com/sely1724/README-generator). Go to your integrated terminal and run using the command “node index.js”.
